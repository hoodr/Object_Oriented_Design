Object Oriented Design

    View-Centric:
        FishTank
        FishFrame
        FishPanel
    Model-Centric:
        Octopus
        AngelFish
        MeanFish
        OctopusFactory
        AngelFishFactory
        MeanieFactory
    Model-View Mix:
        HorizontalMovement
        UpDownMovement
        OscillatingMovement

    Each movement is a mix of model and view because the class is used by the model to assign to each fish, but it really is used by the view in displaying the fish

3.
    a.)  Fish Factories and Fish
    b.)  FishTank FishFrame FishPanel
    c.)  The FTModelObserver should have registerObserver(), removeObserver(), updateObserver(), and notifyObserver() methods.
    d.)  The FTViewObserver should have registerObserver(), removeObserver(), updateObserver(), and notifyObserver() methods.
    e.)  The Controller would need to call methods to display fish and the variables of how to display the frame, like size etc.
    f.)  The Controller would need to call the Fish Factory methods to create fish
    g.)  The Fish Tank Model should handle the animation timer. The controller should be an action listener.
