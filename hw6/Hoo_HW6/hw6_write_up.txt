1. A description of anything you did that went beyond what was required.

  I added a new Fish called "Shark." The Shark movement is called TeleportMovement. It allows the shark to teleport around the environment. I also added a random spawn point for each fish within the tank area

2. See attached

2. If you wanted to change the program to accommodate another type of fish:
  
  What new Java classes would you need to create?
    You would need a new fish class, and a new Fish Factory class for that fish.

  What existing Java classes would you need to modify, and what would the modifications be?
    You would need to modify FishMenuBar and FishFactory to accomate for the added fish. The menu bar needs a new fish option, and an event listener. FishFactory needs and added switch statement to select the correct factory for the new fish
